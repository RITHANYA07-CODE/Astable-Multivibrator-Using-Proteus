## Theory  
•	The NE555 timer is a widely used integrated circuit for generating precise time delays and oscillations. When operated in astable mode, it functions as a free-running oscillator that continuously produces a square wave without any external triggering signal. In this mode, a capacitor connected to the circuit charges through resistors R1 and R2 and discharges through R2 repeatedly. The internal voltage divider of the 555 timer creates two reference levels at 1/3 Vcc and 2/3 Vcc.   
•	When the capacitor voltage reaches 2/3 Vcc, the upper comparator resets the flip-flop and turns ON the discharge transistor, causing the capacitor to discharge. When the voltage falls to 1/3 Vcc, the lower comparator sets the flip-flop, turning OFF the discharge transistor and allowing the capacitor to charge again. This continuous charging and discharging process generates a square wave at the output (Pin 3) and an exponential waveform across the capacitor. The time period of oscillation is given by T=0.693(R1+2R2)CT = 0.693 (R1 + 2R2) CT=0.693(R1+2R2)C, and the frequency depends on the values of R1, R2, and C. Thus, the 555 timer in astable mode acts as a simple and reliable square wave generator used in clock circuits, LED flashers, and pulse generation applications.

## Viva Questions

### 1. What are the operating modes of 555 timer?

The 555 timer operates in three modes:
- **Monostable mode** (One-shot)
- **Astable mode** (Free running oscillator)
- **Bistable mode** (Flip-flop)

### 2. What are the threshold levels in astable mode?

In astable mode, the capacitor charges and discharges between:

$$
\frac{1}{3} V_{CC}
$$

and

$$
\frac{2}{3} V_{CC}
$$

### 3. Write the frequency formula.

For astable mode:

$$
f = \frac{1.44}{(R_1 + 2R_2)C}
$$

### 4. What is duty cycle?

Duty cycle is the percentage of time the output is HIGH in one complete cycle.

$$
\text{Duty Cycle} = \frac{T_{ON}}{T} \times 100\%
$$

For astable mode:

$$
\text{Duty Cycle} = \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_1 + 2R_2} \times 100\%
$$

### 5. What happens if R2 increases?

- Time period increases  
- Frequency decreases  
- Duty cycle increases  
- Output waveform becomes HIGH for a longer duration
